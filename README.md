# LT2326 - Machine learning for statistical NLP: Advanced
## Project â€“ The Winograd Schema Challenge

The following GitHub repository presents the work done for the project of the LT2326 course on Machine Learning for Statistical NLP: Advanced, by gusgraupa. The project is a very simple adaptation of the Winograd Schema Challenge, where we build a language model and get sentence probabilities. 

The implementation of the project can be found in this GitHub repository. The main file used is a Jupyter Notebook (LT2326 - Project.ipynb), which contains most of the code used, as well as a python file (processing_wiki_data.py) for some of the data pre-processing. The data in the repository is all that is needed for the Notebook, so there is no need to process it again. The trained language models have been saved in mltgpu, in the folder scratch/gusgraupa .
